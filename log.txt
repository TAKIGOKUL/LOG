The digital abyss beckons, 
a siren song of procrastination. 

YouTube, a vortex of distractions, threatens to consume me.
 The weight of an impending exam hangs heavy, a looming deadline that I dare not confront.

A flicker of ambition ignites within me, a desire to conquer the coding challenges of LeetCode. 
Yet, a darker reality intrudes, a financial crisis that threatens to shatter my dreams. 
My promises to my beloved, once sacred vows, now hang in the balance.

I must rise above this lethargy, must harness the inner strength to break free from this cycle of self-defeat. 
The future, uncertain and fraught with peril, demands action.
